;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is a simple package to automatically preview in a side window the
;; file at point in Dired buffers.  Preview windows are closed when they
;; are no longer relevant, while preview buffers are killed if they have
;; not been used for other purposes beside previewing.
;;
;; Enable the `dired-preview-mode' in the current Dired buffer or
;; `dired-preview-global-mode' for all Dired buffers and then perform
;; the regular up/down motions.  Those will trigger the preview.
;;
;; The previewed file is displayed in a side window if its size is below
;; the number specified in the user option `dired-preview-max-size'.
;; Previews are shown subject to a small delay, per ther user option
;; `dired-preview-delay'.
;;
;; Files matching the `dired-preview-ignored-extensions-regexp' are not
;; previewed.  The default value of that user option includes multimedia,
;; PDFs, and EPUBs.
;;
;; [ In the future, we may find ways to quickly preview any file type
;;   without affecting the performance of Emacs.]
;;
;; I took inspiration for `dired-preview' from the now unmaintained
;; `peep-dired' package by Adam Sokolnicki: <https://github.com/asok/peep-dired>.
;; My original plan was to volunteer to maintain `peep-dired` but I
;; decided to write it my own way: it was easier for me, plus I can
;; implement only what I consider necessary without upsetting existing
;; users.
