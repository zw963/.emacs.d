;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Workgroups2 is an Emacs session manager.  It is based on the
;; experimental branch of the original "workgroups" extension.
;;
;; If you find a bug - please post it here:
;; https://github.com/pashinin/workgroups2/issues
;;
;; Quick start,
;;
;; - `wg-create-workgroup' to save current windows layout
;; - `wg-open-workgroup' to open saved windows layout
;;
;; Optionally, you can use minor-mode `workgroups-mode' by put below
;; line into .emacs ,
;;
;; (workgroups-mode 1)
;;
;; Most commands start with prefix `wg-prefix-key'.
;; You can change it before activating workgroups.
;; Change prefix key (before activating WG)
;;
;; (setq wg-prefix-key "C-c z")
;;
;; By default prefix is: "C-c z"
;;
;; <prefix> C-c    - create new workgroup
;; <prefix> C-v    - open existing workgroup
;;
;; Change workgroups session file,
;;
;;   (setq wg-session-file "~/.emacs.d/.emacs_workgroups")
;;

;; FIXME:
;;
;; Only set `wg-workgroup-base-wconfig' on `wg-save-session-as' or
;; `delete-frame' and only with the most recently changed working-wconfig.
;; Then, since it's not overwritten on every call to
;; `wg-workgroup-working-wconfig', its restoration can be retried after manually
;; recreating buffers that couldn't be restored.  So it takes over the
;; 'incorrect restoration' portion of the base wconfig's duty.  All that leaves
;; to base wconfigs is that they're a saved wconfig the user felt was important.
;; So why not allow more of of them?  A workgroup could stash an unlimited
;; number of wconfigs.

Use `wg-support' macro and this variable will be filled
automatically.

An entry should be either a function symbol or a lambda, and should
accept a single Emacs buffer object as an argument.

When a buffer is to be serialized, it is passed to each of these
functions in turn until one returns non-nil, or the list ends.  A
return value of nil indicates that the function can't handle
buffers of that type.  A non-nil return value indicates that it
can.  The first non-nil return value becomes the buffer's special
serialization data.  The return value should be a cons, with a
deserialization function (a function symbol or a lambda) as the car,
and any other serialization data as the cdr.

When it comes time to deserialize the buffer, the deserialization
function (the car of the cons mentioned above) is passed the
wg-buf object, from which it should restore the buffer.  The
special serialization data itself can be accessed
with (cdr (wg-buf-special-data <wg-buf>)).  The deserialization
function must return the restored Emacs buffer object.

See the definitions of the functions in this list for examples of
how to write your own."
